//Multiwii.cpp is money

int16_t rcSerial[8];         // interval [1000;2000] - is rcData coming from MSP (multiwii serial protocol)
int16_t rcCommand[4];        // interval [1000;2000] for THROTTLE and [-500;+500] for ROLL/PITCH/YAW

//rcSticks is just for stick commands, not that relevant. 

//we're using PID_CONTROLLER 1
